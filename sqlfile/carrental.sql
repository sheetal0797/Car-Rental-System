Most financing banks have an online interface where you can track payments and enter recurring payment information.</span></p></div><div id=\"faq-7\" class=\"col-md-8 faq-item\" style=\"width: 740px; -webkit-box-flex: 0; flex: 0 0 66.6667%; max-width: 66.6667%; color: rgb(52, 58, 64); font-family: soleil, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;;\"><h4 style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 700; line-height: 1.2; color: rgb(22, 25, 30);\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">Are there any hidden or upfront fees?</span></h4><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">No. Unless otherwise stated, all Carlease.com quotes are “no money down” quotes. This means, that a “down payment” is not required–which, if you lease through a dealership, can often run into the thousands of dollars. This also means that you pay the same amount month after month until the end of the lease.</span></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">Note, in your first month, you will be required to pay one-time titling, registration, and documentation fees. These fees typically amount to $200-300 dollars.</span></p></div><div id=\"faq-8\" class=\"col-md-8 faq-item\" style=\"width: 740px; -webkit-box-flex: 0; flex: 0 0 66.6667%; max-width: 66.6667%; color: rgb(52, 58, 64); font-family: soleil, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;;\"><h4 style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 700; line-height: 1.2; color: rgb(22, 25, 30);\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">When can I review the paperwork?</span></h4><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">Typically, the paperwork is available for your review a day or two before delivery. Most customers, review and sign the paperwork at the time of taking delivery; however, we are more than happy to provide you with advanced copies for your review. Of course, you are not committed to take delivery of the vehicle unless and until you are completely satisfied with the paperwork.</span></p></div><div id=\"faq-9\" class=\"col-md-8 faq-item\" style=\"width: 740px; -webkit-box-flex: 0; flex: 0 0 66.6667%; max-width: 66.6667%; color: rgb(52, 58, 64); font-family: soleil, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;;\"><h4 style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 700; line-height: 1.2; color: rgb(22, 25, 30);\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">How do I place an order?</span></h4><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">Simple.

If you have a trade or off-lease vehicle, please be sure to tell your sales representative so that we can evaluate the vehicle and its impact on the price of the new leased vehicle.</span></p></div><div id=\"faq-11\" class=\"col-md-8 faq-item\" style=\"width: 740px; -webkit-box-flex: 0; flex: 0 0 66.6667%; max-width: 66.6667%; color: rgb(52, 58, 64); font-family: soleil, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;;\"><h4 style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 700; line-height: 1.2; color: rgb(22, 25, 30);\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">How do I set up a test drive?</span></h4><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">Carlease maintains partnerships with our dealer network. We encourage our customers to test drive vehicles prior to taking delivery and can assist in facilitating scheduled test drives with our dealer partners. Remember you are under no obligation to buy a car from the dealer where you test drive.</span></p></div><div id=\"faq-12\" class=\"col-md-8 faq-item\" style=\"width: 740px; -webkit-box-flex: 0; flex: 0 0 66.6667%; max-width: 66.6667%; color: rgb(52, 58, 64); font-family: soleil, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;;\"><h4 style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 700; line-height: 1.2; color: rgb(22, 25, 30);\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">Are you able to match advertised lease specials?</span></h4><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">Yes. Our pricing is always competitive. Most advertised lease rates through dealers require a down payment. We typically recommend spreading that down payment across the lease term creating a more consistent budgeting option for our customers. Additionally, we are able to leverage all available manufacturer incentives in addition to many private incentives available to consumers who are members of exclusive networks. We always work with our dealer partners to beat advertised lease specials for a given make/model. The advertised lease special is often confusing to buyers. We can walk you through the numbers and help you make a good decision on finding the properly equipped car for your needs, along with a lease program most advantageous to your specific situation. For many people, leasing makes great sense.</span></p></div><div id=\"faq-13\" class=\"col-md-8 faq-item\" style=\"width: 740px; -webkit-box-flex: 0; flex: 0 0 66.6667%; max-width: 66.6667%; color: rgb(52, 58, 64); font-family: soleil, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;;\"><h4 style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 700; line-height: 1.2; color: rgb(22, 25, 30);\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">How are you compensated for sourcing my vehicle?</span></h4><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">We typically receive a referral fee from dealers on new leases. Carlease’s fee is based on the incentives available to the customer on the vehicle and always takes into consideration the best available financing in the market. Our negotiated pricing allow Carlease to acquire vehicles on our customer’s behalf at less than the price at which they would usually be able to source new vehicles on their own. Additionally, because of our relationships, we have access to some of the hardest to find inventory. Dealers want to work with Carlease.com because we deliver closed orders and we own the sales, marketing, and client servicing process. Dealers understand that the effort involved is substantial and our fee represents a small fraction of what their costs would otherwise be to close the same transaction volume and earn additional manufacturer bonuses. Our customers benefit by gaining access to hard to find inventory, better pricing, no haggling, and an ease of execution in taking delivery of their new vehicles.</span></p></div><div id=\"faq-14\" class=\"col-md-8 faq-item\" style=\"width: 740px; -webkit-box-flex: 0; flex: 0 0 66.6667%; max-width: 66.6667%; color: rgb(52, 58, 64); font-family: soleil, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;;\"><h4 style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 700; line-height: 1.2; color: rgb(22, 25, 30);\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">Do you work with buyers throughout the U.S.?</span></h4><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">Carlease.com works with commercial customers throughout the continental US. Consumer vehicles are presently available in Illinois and select markets in the upper Midwest but can be shipped at the customer expense in specific cases. We are expanding our consumer vehicle capabilities to additional cities and states in 2018.</span></p></div><div id=\"faq-15\" class=\"col-md-8 faq-item\" style=\"width: 740px; -webkit-box-flex: 0; flex: 0 0 66.6667%; max-width: 66.6667%; color: rgb(52, 58, 64); font-family: soleil, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;;\"><h4 style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 700; line-height: 1.2; color: rgb(22, 25, 30);\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">Do you lease buses, specialty vehicles, and custom designed vehicles?</span></h4><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">We operate and specialize in fleet management and fleet analysis services. This constitutes a major focus, strength, and differentiator of our business. We are experts in custom bus and vehicle configurations and can advise on the best options to fit your specific needs. Whether those needs are ADA and wheelchair accessibility, mobile office configuration, or specialized bus assemblies. Our commercial vehicles are sourced in the same manner as our passenger vehicles, through our network of partner dealers.</span></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">We typically recommend using TRAC leases (Terminal Rental Adjustment Clause). TRAC Leasing is the most popular avenue to acquire commercial equipment. Over 80% of businesses take advantage of leasing to reduce the expensive upfront costs of purchasing equipment as well as creating a trade cycle to ensure they are acquiring the most technically advanced equipment on the market. A TRAC lease gives the purchaser the option to buy the vehicle at a predetermined value at the end of the lease or to trade up to new equipment.</span></p></div><div id=\"faq-16\" class=\"col-md-8 faq-item\" style=\"width: 740px; -webkit-box-flex: 0; flex: 0 0 66.6667%; max-width: 66.6667%; color: rgb(52, 58, 64); font-family: soleil, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;;\"><h4 style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-weight: 700; line-height: 1.2; color: rgb(22, 25, 30);\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">What is a TRAC (Terminal Rental Adjustment Clause) lease?</span></h4><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">A TRAC value lease is a true lease for tax purposes, meaning the Lessor owns the equipment for tax purposes, depreciates the equipment, and passes a portion of the tax depreciation to the customer (Lessee) in the form of a lower payment. The lease contains a Terminal Rental Adjustment Clause (TRAC), in which the lessee takes on the residual risk/reward. At the end of a TRAC Lease the lessee has several options.</span></p><ol style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><li><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">Pay the TRAC amount and the lessee owns the vehicle (the residual can often be financed).</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">Use the residual value as a trade in on a new vehicle.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">Return the vehicle to the Lessor and the lessor will sell the vehicle.</span></li></ol><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">If the sale price is more than the TRAC amount, the lessor will pay the difference to the lessee. If the sale price is less than the TRAC amount, the lessee will pay the difference to the lessor. A TRAC lease can be considered an operating lease or a capitalized lease on your financial statements so you can consider this as an off balance sheet financing.</span></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">TRAC lease payments can be completely expensed; an advantage that most companies realize with leasing as opposed to financing their equipment.</span></p></div>\r\n										\r\n										');
